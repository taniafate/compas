Nuxt.js (v3), Vue.js (v3) Composition API, TypeScript, SCSS modules.


## Task

The work has been completed on all points of the task:

1. Compliance with pixel perfect
2. The presence of semantics
3. Availability of mobile adaptation
4. All buttons must be clickable
5. In the header, links should lead to empty pages with the title
6. When you click on the form, display a notification that the data has been sent
7. The links in the slider should lead to separate pages
8. The buttons must have hover effects
9. Input fields should display styles when you focus on them
10. When clicking on the logo, a redirect to the main page should take place
11. The use of preprocessors and nuxt 3 is mandatory
12. When you click on the "About service" button, open a modal window with a link to any video
13. If the form fields are not filled in, then prohibit sending data and change the color of the borders of the fields to red.


## Important information for the examiner

The pixel perfect principle was not followed in cases where there were imperfections in the design system:
for example, labels for buttons or links of the same type should have the same font size.
